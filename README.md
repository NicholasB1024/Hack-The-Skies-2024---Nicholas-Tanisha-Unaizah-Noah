# Hack The Skies 2024
## Submission by Nicholas, Tanisha, Unaizah, Noah
Our submission is called PathFindr.

With this project, we aimed to build upon known pathfinding algorithms in graph theory to develop a public tranportation system. Users can use an app to send pickup requests, where they identify where they want to be picked up and where they want to be dropped off. This information is then used to determine which of a fleet of PathFindr vehicles is the closest, and adds the location of the pickup request as a stop on the route. Pathfindr vehicles are continuously moving around and are having their routes contstantly updated depending on where the demand is. This allows for a much greater degree of flexibility than conventional public transit systems. The goal of PathFindr is not to replace conventional methods of public transit, such as busses, but rather to work alonside them and have PathFindr fill in the areas where our current transit systems are lacking. For example, the high levels of flexibility that PathFindr offers allows would enable it to be used in less dense areas such as smaller towns, where the demand and/or resources would not justify a regular bus system.
